#For this project I downloaded the Spotify data set on kaggle.
#Then I created a table for the data.
#Finally I asked myself a couple questions to familiarize myself with the data set.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First I determined the top 10 songs by popularity.
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#Then I found the max and min tempo for the songs.
SELECT max(tempo) as max_tempo, min(tempo) as min_tempo
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata

#Last I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

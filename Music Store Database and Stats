Check out my music store database here. Notice how I've described each piece of code (first I created a music store database, then took the sum
of the prices of each daw and displayed the database ordered by daw).


Create table Musicstore (id integer primary key, name text, daw text, price integer, amount_sold integer);

Insert into Musicstore Values 
(1, 'autotune', 'pro tools', 200, 4),
(2, 'wavestune', 'logic', 100, 3),
(3, 'omnisphere', 'pro tools', 500, 54),
(4, 'alchemy', 'logic', 10, 300),
(5, 'sineman', 'fl studio', 30, 45);

Select daw, sum (price) 
From musicstore 
Group By daw
Order By daw desc;

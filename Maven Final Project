#1 My partner and I want to come by each of the stores in person and meet the managers. 
Please send over the managers’ names at each store, with the full address 
of each property (street address, district, city, and country please).  


Select
first_name as manager_firstname, last_name as manager_last_name,
address, district,
city, country
from store
left join staff on staff.store_id = store.store_id
left join address on address.address_id = store.address_id
left join city on address.city_id = city.city_id
left join country on city.country_id = country.country_id;

#2 I would like to get a better understanding of all of the inventory that would come along with the business. 
Please pull together a list of each inventory item you have stocked, including the store_id number, 
the inventory_id, the name of the film, the film’s rating, its rental rate and replacement cost. 


Select store.store_id, inventory.inventory_id, film.title, film.rating, film.rental_rate, film.replacement_cost
from inventory
left join store on inventory.store_id = store.store_id
left join film on film.film_id = inventory.film_id;


#3	From the same list of films you just pulled, please roll that data up and provide a summary level overview 
of your inventory. We would like to know how many inventory items you have with each rating at each store. 

Select inventory.store_id, count(inventory.inventory_id) as movie_count, film.rating
from inventory
left join film on film.film_id = inventory.film_id
group by inventory.store_id, film.rating;
 
#4 Similarly, we want to understand how diversified the inventory is in terms of replacement cost. We want to 
see how big of a hit it would be if a certain category of film became unpopular at a certain store.
We would like to see the number of films, as well as the average replacement cost, and total replacement cost, 
sliced by store and film category. 

Select store_id, category.name as category, 
count(film.film_id) as number_of_films, 
avg(film.replacement_cost) as avg_film_cost,
sum(film.replacement_cost) as total_replacement_cost
from inventory
left join film on inventory.film_id = film.film_id
left join film_category on film.film_id = film_category.film_id
left join category on category.category_id = film_category.category_id
group by store_id, category.name;
 

#6 We would like to understand how much your customers are spending with you, and also to know 
who your most valuable customers are. Please pull together a list of customer names, their total 
lifetime rentals, and the sum of all payments you have collected from them. It would be great to 
see this ordered on total lifetime value, with the most valuable customers at the top of the list. 


select customer.first_name, customer.last_name,
count(payment.rental_id) as total_lifetime_rentals, sum(payment.amount) as payments_collected
from customer
left join payment on payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
group by customer.first_name, customer.last_name
order by sum(payment.amount) desc;
   
/*
7. My partner and I would like to get to know your board of advisors and any current investors.
Could you please provide a list of advisor and investor names in one table? 
Could you please note whether they are an investor or an advisor, and for the investors, 
it would be good to include which company they work with.

select 'advisor' as type, first_name, last_name, null
from advisor 

union

select 'investor' as type, first_name, last_name, company_name
from investor;
